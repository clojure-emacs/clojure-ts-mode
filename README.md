# Clojure Tree-Sitter Mode

`clojure-ts-mode` is an Emacs major mode that provides font-lock (syntax
highlighting), indentation, and navigation support for the
[Clojure(Script) programming language](http://clojure.org), powered by the
[tree-sitter-clojure](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure)
[tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar.

## Configuration

To see a list of available configuration options do `M-x customize-group <RET> clojure-ts`.

Most configuration changes will require reverting any active `clojure-ts-mode` buffers.

### Indentation

`clojure-ts-mode` currently supports 2 different indentation strategies:

- `semantic`, the default, which tries to match the indentation of `clojure-mode` and `cljfmt`
- `fixed`, [a simple indentation strategy outlined by Tonsky in a blog post](https://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/)

Set the var `clojure-ts-indent-style` to change it.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq clojure-ts-indent-style 'fixed)
```

**Note:** You can find [this article](https://metaredux.com/posts/2020/12/06/semantic-clojure-formatting.html) comparing semantic and fixed indentation useful.

### Font Locking

To highlight entire rich `comment` expression with the comment font face, set

``` emacs-lisp
(setq clojure-ts-comment-macro-font-lock-body t)
```

By default this is `nil`, so that anything within a `comment` expression is
highlighted like regular clojure code.

### Highlight markdown syntax in docstrings

By default markdown syntax is highlighted in the docstrings using
`markdown_inline` grammar. To disable this feature set

``` emacs-lisp
(setopt clojure-ts-use-markdown-inline nil)
```

### Navigation and Evaluation

To make forms inside of `(comment ...)` forms appear as top-level forms for evaluation and navigation, set

``` emacs-lisp
(setq clojure-ts-toplevel-inside-comment-form t)
```

### Fill paragraph

To change the maximal line length used by `M-x prog-fill-reindent-defun` (also
bound to `M-q` by default) to reformat docstrings and comments it's possible to
customize `clojure-ts-fill-paragraph` variable (by default set to the value of
Emacs' `fill-paragraph` value).

Every new line in the docstrings is indented by
`clojure-ts-docstring-fill-prefix-width` number of spaces (set to 2 by default
which matches the `clojure-mode` settings).

## Rationale

[clojure-mode](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode) has served us well
for a very long time, but it suffers from a few [long-standing
problems](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode#caveats), related to
Emacs limitations baked into its design. The introduction of built-in support
for Tree-sitter in Emacs 29 provides a natural opportunity to address many of
them. Enter `clojure-ts-mode`.

Keep in mind that the transition to `clojure-ts-mode` won't happen overnight for several reasons:

- getting to feature parity with `clojure-mode` will take some time
- tools that depend on `clojure-mode` will need to be updated to work with `clojure-ts-mode`
- we still need to support users of older Emacs versions that don't support Tree-sitter

That's why `clojure-ts-mode` is being developed independently of `clojure-mode`
and will one day replace it when the time is right. (e.g. 3 major Emacs version
down the road, so circa Emacs 32)

You can read more about the vision for `clojure-ts-mode` [here](https://metaredux.com/posts/2023/03/12/clojure-mode-meets-tree-sitter.html).

## Current Status

**This library is still under active development. Breaking changes should be expected.**

## Installation

### Emacs 29

This package requires Emacs 29 built with tree-sitter support from the [emacs-29 branch](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/log/?h=emacs-29).

If you decide to build Emacs from source there's some useful information on this in the Emacs repository:

- [Emacs tree-sitter starter-guide](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide?h=emacs-29)
- [Emacs install instructions](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/INSTALL.REPO).

To check if your Emacs supports tree sitter run the following (e.g. by using `M-:`):

``` emacs-lisp
(treesit-available-p)
```

### Install clojure-ts-mode

clojure-ts-mode is available on [MElPA](https://melpa.org/#/clojure-ts-mode) and
[NonGNU ELPA](https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/clojure-ts-mode.html).
It can be installed with

``` emacs-lisp
(package-install 'clojure-ts-mode)
```

#### package-vc

Emacs 29 also includes `package-vc-install`, so you can run

``` emacs-lisp
(package-vc-install "https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-ts-mode")
```

to install this package from source.

#### Manual installation

You can install it by cloning the repository and adding it to your load path.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-ts-mode.git
```

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/clojure-ts-mode/")
```

Once installed, evaluate clojure-ts-mode.el and you should be ready to go.

### Install tree-sitter grammars

`clojure-ts-mode` makes use of two TreeSitter grammars to work properly:

- The Clojure grammar, mentioned earlier
- [markdown_inline](https://github.com/MDeiml/tree-sitter-markdown), which
will be used for docstrings if available and if `clojure-ts-use-markdown-inline` is enabled.

If you have `git` and a C compiler (`cc`) available on your system's `PATH`,
`clojure-ts-mode` will install the
grammars when you first open a Clojure file and `clojure-ts-ensure-grammars` is
set to `t` (the default).

If `clojure-ts-mode` fails to automatically install the grammar, you have the
option to install it manually, Please, refer to the installation instructions of
each required grammar and make sure you're install the versions expected. (see
`clojure-ts-grammar-recipes` for details)

## Migrating to clojure-ts-mode

If you are migrating to `clojure-ts-mode` note that `clojure-mode` is still required for cider and clj-refactor packages to work properly.

After installing the package do the following.

- Check the value of `clojure-mode-hook` and copy all relevant hooks to `clojure-ts-mode-hook`.

``` emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'clojure-ts-mode-hook #'cider-mode)
(add-hook 'clojure-ts-mode-hook #'enable-paredit-mode)
(add-hook 'clojure-ts-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
(add-hook 'clojure-ts-mode-hook #'clj-refactor-mode)
```

- Update `.dir-locals.el` in all of your Clojure projects to activate directory local variables in `clojure-ts-mode`.

``` emacs-lisp
((clojure-mode
  (cider-clojure-cli-aliases . ":test:repl"))
 (clojure-ts-mode
  (cider-clojure-cli-aliases . ":test:repl")))
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does `clojure-ts-mode` work with CIDER?

Yes! Preliminary support for `clojure-ts-mode` was released in [CIDER
1.14](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.14.0). Make sure to
grab the latest CIDER from MELPA/GitHub. Note that `clojure-mode` is still
needed for some APIs that haven't yet been ported to `clojure-ts-mode`.

For now, when you take care of the keybindings for the CIDER commands you use
and ensure `cider-mode` is enabled for `clojure-ts-mode` buffers in your config,
most functionality should already work:

```emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'clojure-ts-mode-hook #'cider-mode)
```

Check out [this article](https://metaredux.com/posts/2024/02/19/cider-preliminary-support-for-clojure-ts-mode.html) for more details.

### Does `clojure-ts-mode` work with `inf-clojure`?

Currently, there is an [open PR](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure/pull/215) adding support for inf-clojure.
