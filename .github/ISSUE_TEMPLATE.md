## Environment & Version information

### clojure-ts-mode version

*Include here the version string displayed by `M-x
clojure-ts-mode-display-version`. Here's an example:*

```
clojure-ts-mode (version 0.1.5)
```

### tree-sitter-clojure grammar version

*E.g. v0.0.12*

*Please make sure you are using compatible tree-sitter grammars.
See the variable clojure-ts-grammar-recipes for the current recommend versions.
They should be installed automatically if not found.
However, some linux distributions package these same grammars and Emacs will use them if found.*

**If you are not sure what version you are using, try running
M-x treesit-install-language-grammar <RET> clojure <RET> y, and use the values
https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure.git for the URL,
v0.0.12 for the TAG and default values for the remaining options.
Then see if the problem still persists.**

### Emacs version

*E.g. 29.1* (use <kbd>C-h C-a</kbd> to see it)

### Operating system
